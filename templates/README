IHazAYoorel
===========

A simple generator that adds a URL shortening service
to an app.  Includes some very simple views and
controller functionality, which you'll probably want
to expand upon and experiment with.

Add the i_haz_a_yoorel to your .rails/generators
folder, or to your project's generators folder,
then run:

  script/generate i_haz_a_yoorel
  rake db:migrate

it will create a table called url_redirections to
store redirection information.

You'll probably want to modify the code to suit
your needs.  By default:

  * Url ids start at url/1 and go to url/z.
  * Url ids are case insensitive.
  * Urls don't expire or track the last time they
    were used.
  * Urls do keep track of the number of times they've
    been used.
  * No checks are done to ensure that the URL given
    is valid, safe, not a phishing site, or suitable
    for children.

To create a new URL, go to http://your.app/url_redirection/new.


Routing
=======

Since URL shortening services are supposed to give you
*short* urls, the default route '/url_redirection/redirect/b0byzx'
is probably inadequate.  I'd recommend adding something like
the following to your config/routes.rb:

  map.redirection '/url/:id',
                  :controller => 'url_redirection',
                  :action => 'redirect'

which should give you nice urls like 'url/b0byzx'.

Note:  The example view uses the redirection_url function,
which assumes that something like this is already
present in your routing.
