Generator of Generators
=======================

A Rails generator that generates -- what else? --
other generators.


This project took some inspiration from
rails-generator-generator, which can be found at:

http://github.com/spejman/rails-generator-generator/tree/master

Hopefully people will find this one to be more
configurable.  Plus I put some example code and
explanations in the generated generator file.
I hope more people like that than hate it.


Examples
========

script/generate generator SaltedAndHashedCookie
   create  vendor/generators/salted_and_hashed_cookie
   create  vendor/generators/salted_and_hashed_cookie/templates
   create  vendor/generators/salted_and_hashed_cookie/salted_and_hashed_cookie_generator.rb
   create  vendor/generators/salted_and_hashed_cookie/MIT-LICENSE


script/generate generator ButterflyMigration dir=vendor/plugins
      exists  vendor/plugins
      create  vendor/plugins/templates
      create  vendor/plugins/butterfly_migration_generator.rb
      create  vendor/plugins/MIT-LICENSE
      create  vendor/plugins/templates/migration.rb

If your name argument ends in "migration", it will
automatically generate a migration template, which
will be placed in the migrations directory when
the generated generator is run.  In the previous
example, it would be called "create_butterfly_migration.rb"


Note:  If you do a symlink from the generator directory
to named_generator, invoking the generator as
named_generator will cause it to output a NamedBase
generator instead of a Base generator.

Secondary note:  You'll want to clone the repo like so:

git clone git@github.com:darthschmoo/i_am_gog_generator_of_generators.git generator

Without the 'generator' at the end, every time you use gog,
you'll have to type:

   script/generate i_am_gog_generator_of_generators SaltedCookie

and I don't see that being fun for anybody.
